This repository gathers the code I have implemented to tackle the OffensEval 2019 challenge hosted on Codalab (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011#learn_the_details).
I participated to this challenge as being the coursework to the Natural Language Processing course taught at Imperial College London.

You will find on this repository:
 - A "NLP_main.ipynb" file, which is a jupyter notebook meant to be opened in a Google Collab environment and which gathers the majority of the code as well as comments. The files to be imported in the collab environment can be found in the /data folder.
 - A folder data/ containing all the .txt and .tsv files that have been used for this challenge. The code used to create them is available in the python files "data_management.py" and "corpus.py".
 - Some python files that can be opened and edited with a local IDE (more readable than Collab). The code is redundant with the notebook.
 - The final report for this challenge.
 
 For any question regarding the code for this challenge, please write to contact@jarasse.fr
